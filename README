#Intro：
On one hand, when searching a question in computer programming, people are usually expecting to see
a highly recommended answer and save the time clicking each results search engine returns. 
On the other hand, platforms such as Stack Overflow have accumulated a huge amount of valuable answers
on a wide range of topics in computer programming[1]. So, our team will try to leverage those answers 
to provide a knowledge bar for programming questions.
In this project, our team also takes efforts to check users’ spelling mistake and 
provide suggestion query for possible mistake in the light of Pseduo-Relevance-Feedback.
