Compile:

Normally, if current directory is src/,  javac edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/*.java should do the job, but if anything wrong occurs, manually compile all the java file in 
directory edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/http/. I.e.:

  javac edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/*.java
  javac edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/http/*.java.


Ranker: 
For numviews ranker, the query string would be "ranker=numviews"
The beta values used in linear ranker are all 0.25.
The tf.idf weight is calculated as described in the book.
Also In numviews and phrase ranker, I use logarithm on the counts. Say we have N counts the score would be log(N) + 1 if N is not zero.


Evaluator:

When server is running, if current directory is src/, then type in terminal:

  curl "http://localhost:25801/search?query=bing&ranker=QL&format=text" | java edu.nyu.cs.cs2580.Evaluator ../data/qrels.tsv
  
This will show result for query = "bing", ranker = "QL" in standard output. 


Logging:
For html format, simply open a browser and hit http://localhost:25801. Different browser will have different seesion id and default render
ten documents. User could change how many documents retrieved in browser. Render and click would be logged in hw1.4-log.tsv.
