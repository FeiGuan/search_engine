# Part 1: Compile and run:

Change in the parent directory of src first and then, 
1.1 To compile,

  $ javac [-encoding utf8] -cp jsoup.jar src/edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/*.java
  
1.2.1 Run mining mode :

  $ java -cp jsoup.jar:src edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/SearchEngine --mode=mining --options=conf/engine.conf

1.2.2 Run index mode:

  $ java -cp jsoup.jar:src edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/SearchEngine --mode=index --options=conf/engine.conf
  
1.2.3 Run server mode:

  $ java -cp jsoup.jar:src edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/SearchEngine --mode=serve --port=25801 --options=conf/engine.conf

#FrontEnd:
Repositories contain front end code which runs  on node.js, you need to install node.js and bower in order
to run the front end. Once all library has been installed, go to fronen directory and run: node app.js
Then go to browser enter localhost:3000.

#For Your Infomation:
The project contains some file with utf-8 encoding character, you may need to add -encoding utf8 to compile.
Different system may require different delimiter between classpath you may need to change from ":" to ";"
The word being searched is stemmed, and stopwords will be filtered, if you want word to as it is, double
quote that single word.
     
#Intro：
On one hand, when searching a question in computer programming, people are usually expecting to see
a highly recommended answer and save the time clicking each results search engine returns. 
On the other hand, platforms such as Stack Overflow have accumulated a huge amount of valuable answers
on a wide range of topics in computer programming[1]. So, our team will try to leverage those answers 
to provide a knowledge bar for programming questions.
In this project, our team also takes efforts to check users’ spelling mistake and 
provide suggestion query for possible mistake in the light of Pseduo-Relevance-Feedback.
