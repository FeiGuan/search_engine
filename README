For RankerFavorite it is a QL ranker.
We use jsoup (which sholud be at the same level as src) library to parse html, thus
For compile:
javac -cp jsoup.jar src/edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/*.java

For constructing the index
java -cp src:jsoup.jar edu.nyu.cs.cs2580.SearchEngine --mode=index --options=conf/engine.conf
After constructing, in data/index, it should appear many files one is wiki.idx, and many wikiIndexPart*.idx and
wikipart*.list files, all serve as index on disk.

For running the server
java -cp src:jsoup.jar -Xmx512m edu.nyu.cs.cs2580.SearchEngine  --mode=serve --port=258XX --options=conf/engine.conf

FYI:
When parsing phrase(words with quotes), I only parse phrase with space i.e. ["new york" city] will be parsed in to 
two phrases, while ["new york"city] with no space after the second quote, will be parsed as new york"city.
